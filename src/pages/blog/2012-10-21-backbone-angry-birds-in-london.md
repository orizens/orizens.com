I returned home about two weeks ago from [Appsworld](http://www.apps-world.net/europe/index.php "AppsWorld Website") conference in London. I gave my known talk about developing javascript based application with Backbone.js, Require.js &#8211; incorporating the Angry Birds game as a Demo.
  
This is a summary of my talk and my experience.<!--more-->


  
After talking with a friend, he introduced me to one of Appsworld organizers who looked for speakers for html5 track. AppsWorld has been twice in the past &#8211; focusing on mobile development as well as desktop development.
  
I gave talks in the past, in Hebrew only. I was then given the challenge to stand in front a worldwide audience, speaking of my passion, in a language I feel comfortable with &#8211; but never gave a 30 minutes professional talk with. Being honest, breaking the barrier of speaking in front of an audience was quite hard for me &#8211; and lots in favor of my current working place, Tikal, and specificaly, [Tikal&#8217;s Knowledge](http://tikalk.com "Tikal Knowledge - Open Source Solutions with Exeprt IT's") CEO &#8211; Lior Kanfi. So &#8211; I saw this opportunity of speaking in front of an audience in English a great challenge and a great experience that I can benefit from &#8211; both Professionally and Personally.
  
The HTML5 Track focused on the new era of developing web applications &#8211; featuring HTML5 vs native apps debate and HTML5 related case studies.
  
My talk, [Object Orient Javascript & Javascript Architecture](http://orizens.github.com/oopjs-talk/ "OOP Javascript & JS Architecture using Backbone.js and Angry Birds") &#8211; focused on developing javascript based web applications with Backbone.js & Require.js. Demos for this talk show angry birds thrown around to demonstrate the concept of this talk.
  
I was quite nervous and excited during the break that was before my lecture. On the days before the lecture, I practiced the things I was about to say, and just from time to time, practicing it on the subway, whenever I sat to eat something and whenever I had time to practice.
  
I started my talk a bit excited, focusing on talking about my passion, my daily doings &#8211; developing and organizing javascript code and applications. On a retrospective, I spoke fluently and clear even though I felt like i was missing something. Time ran out pretty quick and skipped few slides and was happy to get to the final summary &#8211; which is one of the most important slide. Overall, It was a great experience. I was happy to see people that agreed with on the audience as well as some people laughing and enjoying the funny parts of my talk.
  
I got a great and positive feedback &#8211; both for the subject of my talk, as well as for the clear and fluent English.
  
I managed to record my talk on video so &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCAfH7xdM5o&#038;feature=youtube_gdata_player" title="Oren Farhi's talk about oop js &#038; js architecture" target="_blank">the talk is available on youtube</a>.
