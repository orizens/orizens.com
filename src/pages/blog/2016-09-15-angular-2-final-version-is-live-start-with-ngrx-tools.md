It's official - Angular version 2.0.0 is live. It's been a long ride until the official announcement, and so until then, we had the chance to experiment with it, learn appropriate best practices and common solutions and sharing knowledge as a community.

I've started experimenting with Angular (+2) since the alpha versions. I started exploring its api even before by creating an npm module for writing an [AngularJS component with Angular (+2) ES5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2to1) api.

However, I experimented with Angular (+2) in depth by embracing reactive programming with the rxjs patterns and the awesome [ngrx project](https://github.com/ngrx/) - and eventually shared my insights in my blog and on github.<!--more-->

## Where can I start?

I recommend starting from the [official getting started guide at angular.io](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

There's a huge list of resources at [awesome-angular repository](https://github.com/AngularClass/awesome-angular2) and another list on [angular-education repository](https://github.com/timjacobi/angular2-education).

Aside from that, here is a list of articles that I wrote up until now.

Be sure to checkout my open source live project, <a href="http://orizens.github.io/echoes-ng2" target="_blank">Echoes Player</a> - which I converted from <a href="http://github.com/orizens/echoes" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> (<a href="http://echoesplayer.netlify.app" target="_blank">production app</a>) to <a href="http://github.com/orizens/echoes-ng2" target="_blank">Angular (+2)</a>.
