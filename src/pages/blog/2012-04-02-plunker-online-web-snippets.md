[Plunker](http://plunker.no.de/) is another &#8220;jsfiddle&#8221; competitor.

## Why you should try it?

  1. it&#8217;s editor has a cool elegant design
  2. is uses &#8211; [ACE/Cloud9](http://ace.ajax.org/) as its [code editor](http://plunker.no.de/edit) (based on mozilla&#8217;s bespin open source project).
  3. its uses twitter&#8217;s bootstrap for css.
  4. it has built-in boilerplates for starting your own &#8220;plunker&#8221; such as &#8211; backbone, angular, bootstrap etc.
  5. it has a live preview pane which shows the review of the code
  6. it also has a nice [restful api](http://plunker.no.de/documentation) for developers
