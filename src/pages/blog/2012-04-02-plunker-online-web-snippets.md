## Why you should try it?

  1. it's editor has a cool elegant design
  2. is uses - [ACE/Cloud9](http://ace.ajax.org/) as its [code editor](http://plunker.no.de/edit) (based on mozilla's bespin open source project).
  3. its uses twitter's bootstrap for css.
  4. it has built-in boilerplates for starting your own "plunker" such as - backbone, angular, bootstrap etc.
  5. it has a live preview pane which shows the review of the code
  6. it also has a nice [restful api](http://plunker.no.de/documentation) for developers
