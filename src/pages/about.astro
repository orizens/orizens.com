      Hi - I'm Oren Farhi. I'm an Experienced Software Engineer, Front End Tech
      Lead, focusing on{' '}
      <strong>Front End &amp; Software Architecture</strong> and creating well formed
      applications. <br />I graduated with a{' '}
      <strong>BA in Computer Science &amp; Business Management</strong>{' '}from
      the Open University.
    </p>
    <p class='m-auto'>
      I earned Software Engineering &amp; Development skills by being{' '}
      <strong>self-driven</strong> and making things happen, experimenting, experience,<a

        open source
      </a>{' '}some of my work,<a href='/' class='mx-1'> writing</a>about it and
      reading a lot.
    </p>
    <p class='m-auto'>
      In my work, I incorporate a 3 point perspective to software architecture
      while looking at a challenge with depth and entirety.{' '}
      <br />With my experience - i'm able to lead teams into taking a unique
      perspective, look up and move forward.
    </p>
    <p class='m-auto'>
      <br />I believe in producing easy{' '}
      <strong>maintainable code</strong> for applications. I consult to companies
      and startups on how to approach code in their projects, keep it maintainable
      and focusing on delivering a{' '}
      <strong>high quality</strong> and well tested code.

      When consulting and developing, I like to make a difference by following
