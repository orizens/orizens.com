## Professional Profile
Hi. I'm Oren - An experienced Software Engineer, focusing on Front End & Tech Leading, author of - ["Reactive Programming with Angular and NGRX"](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-2620-9), published by Springer, a dedicated professional helping others to produce **easy & maintainable** code for applications, while focusing on delivering a **high quality** and well tested code (since 2006).

When consulting and developing, I follow simple principles: <br /> seeing the code as a live **reactive system**, implementing best practices of software architecture,
creating **modular &amp; testable code**, Understanding the big picture while **breaking down complex problems**
to smaller challenges, keeping code and app **structure organized** to let other developers easily understand and further extend it, **Automating** development with CI/CD.<br /><br/>
