[Angular](https://blog.angular.io/version-5-0-0-of-angular-now-available-37e414935ced) released **version 5** - deprecating the old http module "**@angular/http**" with the replacement of "**@angular/common/http**". Along with the http module, the jsonp module was also deprecated in favor of a better replacement which is included with the new HttpClient. The usage of jsonp is a little bit different with this version. My open source project, [ngx-typeahead](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-typeahead) - is an auto suggest directive for Angular-Â  allowing to query a remote source either with jsonp or http (and with version 0.1.0 - static list as well). In this article, i'm sharing the steps I took for upgrading the package to use HttpClient and performing a jsonp request with parameters.<!--more-->

## Step 1: Updating The Module Imports

First, lets import the relevant modules. Within src/modules/ngx-typeahead.module.ts, I replaced the code so it will import the new modules. Similar to before, there are 2 modules for using http and jsonp:

```typescript
// Before: with Angular 4
import { HttpModule, JsonpModule } from '@angular/http';
...
@NgModule({
  imports: [CommonModule, HttpModule, JsonpModule],
})

// After: with Angular 5
import { HttpClientModule, HttpClientJsonpModule } from '@angular/common/http';
...
@NgModule({
  imports: [CommonModule, HttpClientModule, HttpClientJsonpModule],
})

```

I also update the src/modules/ngx-typeahead.component.ts to import HttpClient only. Notice that the alternatives to "RequestOptionsArgs" and "URLSearchParams" have been updated too and are used inside a utility function (respectively, "HttpParams" and "HttpParamsOptions":

```typescript
// Before: with Angular 4
import {
  RequestOptionsArgs,
  Response,
  Jsonp,
  URLSearchParams,
  Http
} from '@angular/http';

// After: with Angular 5
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

```

## Step 2: Updating The Http Service Injection

In contrary to the previous version, with Angular 5, "jsonp" is used as a method of the http service. All I had to do is change the injection of the http service to use "HttpClient" as well as remove the "Jsonp" injection:

```typescript
// Before: with Angular 4
constructor(
      private element: ElementRef,
      private viewContainer: ViewContainerRef,
      private jsonp: Jsonp,
      private http: Http,
      private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef
    ) { }

// After: with Angular 5
constructor(
    private element: ElementRef,
    private viewContainer: ViewContainerRef,
    private http: HttpClient,
    private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef
  ) { }
```

## Step 3: Updating the Jsonp call with parameters

In the old version, i used the jsonp service and had to create an options object which includes the parameters to attach for the request. Eventually, I passed 2 arguments to the jsonp method that was used ("get" by default):

```typescript


With the new HttpClient it's a little bit different. "jsonp" is a method that performs the jsonp request. It takes the first argument as the url and the callback string name as the second argument.

```typescript


### Where jsonp request's parameters should be placed with Angular 5?

I had a small challenge with this one: the params in this case should be concatenated as string parameters to the url argument. Since i'm using the new "HttpParams" to construct a params object, I can use the "toString()" to get all parameters as url search parameters and add it to the url:

```typescript
requestJsonp(url, options, callback = 'callback') {
    // options.params is an HttpParams object
    const params = options.params.toString();
    return this.http.jsonp(`${url}?${params}`, callback)
      .map((response: Response) => response[1])
      .map((results: any[]) => results.map((result: string) => result[0]));
  }
```

You can see and experiment with ngx-typeahead in this [plunkr demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/gV6kMSRlogjBKnh3JHU3?p=preview) and in production on my open source alternative player to YouTube: [Echoes Player](http://echoesplayer.com)
